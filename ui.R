Failure to account for the following major issues (and several additional ones not listed) can result in false inference. First, the visitor count results in a Poisson distribution, so a generlized linear model was required. Second, the visitor count was heavily influenced by time of day (as a harmonic), and the day of the week. These effects were so strong that if they were included in the model as fixed effects then they swamped out any effects of the weather. To solve this problem I included these variables as random effects. Third, the data was auto-correlated and required an auto-regressive model. Fourth, the model had overdispersion, so I used a quasi-Poisson link in order to correct the coefficient estimates. Fifth, a large number of models needed to be compared (preferably with multimodel inference) and the results used to predict values in future months. In order to generate predictions, I was forced to simplify the model. Thus the results above are from a generalized linear model that has no random effects nor correlation structure (i.e. auto-regressive).")
